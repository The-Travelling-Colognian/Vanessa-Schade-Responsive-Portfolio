              I am a
              <strong>Front-End Developer, SEO-Manager, Journalist</strong> and
              <strong>Travel Blogger</strong> based in Cologne, Germany.
              <br />
              <br />
              My coding journey started with the beginner course of SheCodes
              since I needed HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills for my job as an
              SEO-Manager. Soon, I was so excited about coding that I also
              signed up for the three advanced courses at SheCodes. I have
              successfully completed the Front-End Development- and the SheCodes
              Responsive courses in which I built a weather app and this
              website. Next, I will be taking the React course where I will
              built a dictionary and another weather app using React.js.
              <br />
              <br />
              Since spring 2018, I have been involved with SEO because it is
              essential for my travel blog. Last year from April to June, I
              attended a professional training as an SEO-Manager at the Cologne
              Chamber of Industry and Commerce and I am a certified SEO-Manager
              ever since.
              <br />
              <br />
              My career as a journalist started in 2001 short after starting my
              studies at university. I have worked as an online journalist, for
              newspapers, radio stations and a television broadcasting among
              others for the Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger, SWR3 and a German-Chilean
              newspaper in Santiago de Chile.
              <br />
              <br />
              I blog bilingually in English and in German on my travel blog

                >The Travelling Colognian</a
              >. The focus of this website is on off the beaten path-,
              adventure- and solo female travels. I travelled to more than 50
              countries and lived in Beijing, Santiago de Chile and San José de
              Costa Rica.
